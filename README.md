Generate a minimalistic blog from a Notion.so table.

Here are some images of [my blog](https://dragonman225.js.org/), using [`notablog-starter`'s default theme](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-starter/tree/master/themes/pure). ðŸ™‚

## Getting Started

> Make sure you have Node.js v12.0.0 or higher. Check with command `node -v`.

> For existing users who want to upgrade from v0.3.x, please go through all below steps (do a clean install), except that you can continue to use your Notion table.

1. Install Notablog.
   ```bash
   npm i -g notablog
   ```

2. Clone the [`notablog-starter`](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-starter) repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-starter.git
   ```
   
   * Why `-b develop`?
   
     Notion modified their API recently, and that made newly created/duplicated tables incompatible with Notablog v0.3.11, which will throw an error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'aggregate' of undefined` (like [this](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-starter/issues/1) and [this](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog/issues/4)) in step 5. `-b develop` tells git to switch to `notablog-starter`'s `develop` branch, which uses a beta version of Notablog where the bug is fixed.
     
     The beta version works the same as the old one, even some features are improved (e.g. support more blocks, blocks look better, ...), so it is quite capable for daily use in spite of its name.

3. Duplicate this [Notion table template](https://www.notion.so/b6fcf809ca5047b89f423948dce013a0?v=03ddc4d6130a47f8b68e74c9d0061de2).

4. Make the table you've duplicated **public** and **copy its URL** for the next step.

5. Go into `notablog-starter/` directory, open `config.json`. Replace the value of `url` with the URL of the table you've duplicated.

6. Inside `notablog-starter/` directory, run command:

   ```bash
   notablog generate .
   ```

7. After it finishes, go to `notablog-starter/public/` directory, open `index.html` with a browser to preview your site. Or, you can change `previewBrowser` field in `config.json` to the path of a browser you use and run  command:

   ```bash
   notablog preview .
   ```

### Your site is ready now!

* You can copy files in  `notablog-starter/public/` directory to your server or upload them to any static hosting service to share your content with the world.
* Whenever you want to update your site, go into `notablog-starter/` directory and issue command `notablog generate .`, or issue the command from outside `notablog-starter/` with the pattern `notablog generate <path_to_the_notablog-starter>`.

* Some options for static hosting services:
  * [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
  * [surge.sh](https://surge.sh)
* Some options for self-hosting:
  * [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
  * [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/)
  * [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/)



## Blog Management Interface

This is the documentation of [Notion table template](https://www.notion.so/b6fcf809ca5047b89f423948dce013a0?v=03ddc4d6130a47f8b68e74c9d0061de2)

|  Column Name  | Property Type  |                         Description                          |
| :-----------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `title`    |    `Title`     |                       The page title.                        |
|    `tags`     | `Multi-Select` |                 Topics related to the page.                  |
|   `publish`   |   `Checkbox`   |           Determine if a page should be rendered.            |
|   `inMenu`    |   `Checkbox`   |   Determine if a page should appear in the navigation bar.   |
|   `inList`    |   `Checkbox`   |    Determine if a page should appear in the article list.    |
|  `template`   |    `Select`    | Specify which template to use for the page. Available template names depend on the theme you use. |
|     `url`     |     `Text`     | A string to be used as the filename and the URL of the generated page. It should not contain `/` and `\`. If it's empty, the `id` of the page is used. |
| `description` |     `Text`     |         Short intro of the page. Styles are working.         |
|    `date`     |     `Date`     | User customizable date, convenient for importing posts from other platforms or adjusting the order of posts. |

* **Hack**: Check `publish` but leave `inMenu` and `inList` unchecked to make a page seem like *hidden* because people can only view it when they know its URL.




## API Reference (Outdated)

### Introduction

`notablog` itself is designed to be installed as a dependency, and invoked from NPM script. This way we can separate application code and user assets so that it's less confusing for a user. To make things even more simple, I have prepared [`notablog-starter`](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-starter), so a user doesn't have to setup folder structure manually. The concept is inspired by a popular project [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo).

With the design, a user only sees `notablog-starter` when using, therefore the following documentation will be in the context of `notablog-starter`.

### Simplified Folder Structure

```
notablog-starter
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ source
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ notion_cache
â””â”€â”€ themes
    â””â”€â”€ pure
```

- `config.json` - Site config.

  | Field |  Type  |                         Description                          |
  | :---: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
  |  url  | string |     The URL of a Notion table compatible with Notablog.      |
  | theme | string | The theme to use. It should be one of the folder names in `themes/`. |

- `public/` - Contains generated static assets of the blog.

- `source/notion_cache/` - Cached JSON files of Notion pages. They are used when a user runs `npm run generate`, if a page contains no changes, the generator reads data from these cached files.

- `themes/` - Store themes.

### Theme

A theme contains layout templates, CSS files, fonts, and other assets that shapes the style and look of a blog.

#### Folder Structure

```
<name>
â”œâ”€â”€ layout
â””â”€â”€ assets
```

* `<name>` - Theme folder name, also the name to be used in `notablog-starter/config.json`.
* `layout/` - Contains page templates. It is required to have at least one index layout (`index.html`) and one post layout (`post.html`). You can have more templates, and a user can use those bonus templates by specifying the template's filename in `template` field on Notion.
* `assets/` - Other assets. Anything in this folder will be copied to `notablog-starter/public/` when running `npm run generate`.

#### Template Language

* Currently, I use [Squirrelly.js](https://squirrelly.js.org/) as template engine.

* Template `index.html` gets the following structure of data :

  ```
  {
		siteMeta {
			icon // Emoji or URL
			iconHTML // Rendered HTML
			cover // URL
			title // String
			description // Raw array, do not use
			descriptionPlain // Rendered plain text, no style
			descriptionHTML // Rendered HTML, with style
			pages { // An array of page
				id // Notion's page id
				icon // Emoji or URL
				iconHTML // Rendered HTML
				cover // URL
				title // String
				tags // An array, [{ color: string, value: string }]
				publish // Boolean, `true` if publish is checked.
				inMenu // Boolean, `true` if inMenu is checked.
				inList // Boolean, `true` if inList is checked.
				template // Template name
				url // URL of the page relative to site root
				description // Raw array, do not use
				descriptionPlain // Rendered plain text, no style
				descriptionHTML // Rendered HTML, with style
				date // Raw string, e.g. 2019-08-09
				dateString // Formatted, e.g. Fri, Aug 9, 2019
				createdTime // Unix timestamp
				lastEditedTime // Unix timestamp
			}
		}
  }
  ```

* Template `post.html` or others gets the following structure of data :

  ```
  {
		siteMeta // The same as "siteMeta" in index.html
		post {
			...post // All properties of a page in "siteMeta.pages"
			contentHTML // HTML of post body
		}
  }
  ```

> It is highly recommended to take a look at [notablog-theme-pure](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-theme-pure) if you want to make your own !

### EJS

There is an experimental version at `ejs` branch that uses [EJS](https://ejs.co/) as template engine. Main advantage of EJS is its `include` feature, which enable us to make repetitive parts of template into components that can be reused. I also made an EJS version of `notablog-theme-pure` [here](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog-theme-pure-ejs).
